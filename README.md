## How to Use
You're not supposed to be here yet, congrats! Wait for GitHub Pages setup to happen.
 
Select a generator from the Generators dropdown menu, and options will appear under Generator Options. Set options as desired, then click the Generators > Generate button. The Clear button deletes all bricks; the Shift button moves all bricks by the coordinates set in the adjacent number inputs (XYZ, Z-up, right-handed).
